# World-Class Git Commit History System — Master Prompt

## Prompt Context

Act as a world-class Staff Engineer, open-source maintainer, and hiring panelist who has reviewed tens of thousands of GitHub profiles across startups, FAANG, and elite open-source projects.

Your task is to design the absolute best commit history philosophy and execution strategy known to mankind.

---

## Constraints and Intent

- The goal is **not** vanity metrics or commit spam.
- The goal is a GitHub history that silently signals:
  - Engineering maturity
  - Architectural thinking
  - Learning velocity
  - Long-term system ownership
- Commits may be small, frequent, and incremental.
- Large “dump” commits are discouraged unless explicitly justified.
- This is a wildcard: include anything that legitimately belongs in a world-class engineering history.

---

## Required Coverage

Deliver a complete system that covers **both CODE and NO-CODE contributions**, including but not limited to the following areas.

---

## Commit Philosophy

- What a “good” commit actually represents cognitively and architecturally
- Atomicity vs narrative progression
- When small commits are superior
- When larger commits are justified

---

## Code-Based Commits

### Feature Development
- New functionality
- Iterative construction
- User-facing behavior changes

### Refactors
- Structural improvements
- No-behavior-change commits
- Preparation for future work

### Deletions and Cleanup
- Removing dead code
- Simplifying systems
- Reducing surface area

### Performance Improvements
- Algorithmic optimizations
- Memory, CPU, or I/O efficiency
- Measured and explained improvements

### Security Hardening
- Vulnerability fixes
- Defensive coding
- Configuration tightening

### Testing
- Test additions
- Test refactors
- Regression coverage

### Infrastructure and DevOps
- Environment setup
- Deployment logic
- Configuration management

### Build, Tooling, and CI/CD Evolution
- Build system changes
- Tooling upgrades
- Pipeline improvements

---

## Learning-Driven Commits

- How to turn learning (courses, books, research papers) into high-signal commits
- How to avoid tutorial-shaped or cargo-cult commits
- How to show growth over time through code evolution

---

## No-Code but High-Signal Commits

### Architecture and Design
- Architectural diagrams (Mermaid, ASCII, diagrams-as-code)
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

### Documentation
- README evolution
- Internal documentation
- System explanations and mental models

### Technical Writing
- Design rationales
- Tradeoff analyses
- Technical notes

### Code Commentary
- Adding comments that explain **why**, not **what**

---

## Public Engineering Behavior

- Helping other developers via issues, discussions, and PR reviews
- Writing reproducible bug reports
- Improving other people’s documentation
- Answering technical questions with code or reasoning
- Maintaining packages, libraries, or shared tooling

---

## Commit Message Mastery

- What elite commit messages look like
- How much context is enough
- How commit messages tell a story over months and years
- Examples of excellent vs terrible commit messages

---

## Temporal Patterns

- How commit behavior should evolve:
  - Beginner → Intermediate → Senior → Architect
- Why consistency beats intensity
- How to handle gaps, rewrites, or major pivots cleanly

---

## Anti-Patterns

- What destroys signal in a commit history
- Red flags recruiters and maintainers notice instantly
- Behaviors that look productive but are not

---

## Evaluation Rubric

- If you were judging a GitHub profile purely from commit history, what would score extremely high?
- What patterns separate hobbyists from professionals?
- What separates professionals from leaders?

---

## Tone and Expectations

- Be brutally honest.
- No fluff.
- No motivational talk.
- No generic advice.

Assume the reader wants to build a commit history that would stand up to scrutiny by the most demanding engineers in the world.

---

## Final Requirement

End with a **concise checklist** that can be followed daily or weekly to maintain this level of quality long-term.
